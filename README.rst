Mice Game Framework
=====================

Welcome to **Mice**! **Mice** is an ECS Game Framework build
on top of pygame. 
It's still in early development and is a small
pet project rather than something that billions will use.


-----------------
Project structure
-----------------

As of now **Mice** is split into two packages:

- ``ecs`` which holds the heart of the entity component system.
- ``mice`` which is the framework with preconfigured systems, components and more.
